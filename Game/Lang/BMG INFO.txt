EDITING:
For editing I highly reccomend
https://github.com/Developers-Collective/NSMBW-BMG-Editor
Unlike other editors, it allows for direct editing of Message.arc and shows the proper entry IDs & flags.

Each entry has flags related to it. These flags control how the BMG entry is written to the textbox.
You can think of the flags being like Reggie! spritedata, but for BMG entries.
Format: 0x00XX0Y00
XX: Font X scale. Normally the X scale of the text in the textbox, but if the default text size is 32 then it's size*2.
 - Note: I assume the intended use for this is to "scale down" strings that are longer in other languages, not sure if that's how it is actually used.
Y: Font to print. 0 = marioFont 1 = PictureFont 2 = MessageFont 3 = numberFont.

INFO:
BMG entry IDs are stored in hexadecimal and seperated into category and message.
Message value is the last 2 digits of the entry number, category is every number before.
For example entry 3c84 is category 3c, message 84.

Our custom BMG entries start at category d0. category d0 stores general purpose messages and layout strings.
BMG entries without any flags set are not written to textboxes directly but are instead grabbed as strings in code.
You do not need to add flags to these entries.

Categories above d0 are used for Koopatlas world names.
World name categories are calculated by d1+world index (world index being the index of that map file in List.txt, starting from 0).
World name messages are the world number in said map file.
For example, map index 1 (fullmap) world 3 (Mushroom Peaks) is entry d203.
